# Project README file

This is **YOUR** Readme file.

**NOTE:** You will submit a PDF version of this readme file named `yourgtaccount-readme-pr4.pdf` containing your writeup (GT account is what you log in with, not your all-digits ID. Example: `jdoe1-readme-pr4.pdf`). This file will be submitted **via Canvas** as a PDF (Project 4 README assignment). You may use any tool you desire to create it, so long as it is a compliant PDF - and for us.

  Compliant means **"we can open it using Acrobat Reader and it is a PDF containing embedded (highlightable) text"**. Embedded text in a PDF refers to text that can be highlighted, searched, and copied (e.g., pasted into Notepad), as opposed to text that’s part of an image or scanned document. Certain tools that print to PDF, such as Microsoft Edge, will print the PDF pages as images where the text cannot be selected.

**The project readme is limited to 12 pages.** Please keep your readme as short as possible
while still covering all requirements of the assignment. Points will be deducted if the project
readme exceeds the page limit.

## Project Description

Please see [readme.md](./readme.md) for the rubric we use for evaluating your submission.

We will manually review your file looking for:

- A summary description of your project design.  

- Any additional observations that you have about what you've done. Examples:
  - **What created problems for you?**
  - **What tests would you have added to the test suite?**
  - **If you were going to do this project again, how would you improve it?**
  - **If you didn't think something was clear in the documentation, what would you write instead?**
